# Rust client for Falcon API - rusty-falcon

Use this API specification as a reference for the API endpoints you can use to interact with your Falcon environment. These endpoints support authentication via OAuth2 and interact with detections and network containment. For detailed usage guides and examples, see our [documentation inside the Falcon console](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation).

  To use the APIs described below, combine the base URL with the path shown for each API endpoint. For commercial cloud customers, your base URL is `https://api.crowdstrike.com`.

  Each API endpoint requires authorization via an OAuth2 token. Your first API request should retrieve an OAuth2 token using the `oauth2/token` endpoint, such as `https://api.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token`. For subsequent requests, include the OAuth2 token in an HTTP authorization header. Tokens expire after 30 minutes, after which you should make a new token request to continue making API requests.

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.  By using the [openapi-spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate an API client.

## Installation

After installing the Rust toolchain, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crowdstrike/rusty-falcon
```

The project uses the OpenSSL sys crate thereby you might need to make `cargo` aware
of the whereabouts of the OpenSSL library. Below, you'll find instructions for
various OS'es.

Chances are, your system has already got all that's needed of the OpenSSL library.
If `cargo check` succeeds, you're all set. If it complains about not finding
OpenSSL, read on.

### APT-based Linux distro's (e.g. Debian and Ubuntu)

Installing the OpenSSL development files should be all that is required:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y openssl-dev
```

### RPM-based Linux distro's (e.g. Fedora and RedHat)

Installing the OpenSSL development files should be all that is required:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y openssl-devel
```

### macOS

Installing the OpenSSL development files should be all that is required:

```sh
brew install openssl
```

If `cargo` can't still find the OpenSSL library, please provide a configuration
files pointing to it like so:

1. Create `.cargo/config.tmol`
2. Add the paths to the configuration file:
```toml
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
OPENSSL_LIB_DIR="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
```

### Windows

Assuming that the source code is stored at `C:/Users/<ME>/src` and you're using
the MSVC toolchain with Rust (the most common scenario on Windows), all that's
needed is cloning the `vcpkg` repo, building and installing the OpenSLL like so:

```pwsh
cd C:/Users/<ME>/src
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# Install the static library
.\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static

# Optional: install dynamic library version, too
.\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
```

Now, tell `cargo` where to find OpenSSL:

1. Create `.cargo/config.tmol`
2. Add the paths to the configuration file:
```toml
[env]
OPENSSL_LIB_DIR="C:/Users/<ME>/src/vcpkg/packages/openssl_x64-windows/lib"
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:/Users/<ME>/src/vcpkg/packages/openssl_x64-windows/include"
```

After that `cargo check` should succeed.
